# -ProgrammingTechniques_A5

The main objective of this assignment is designing, implementing and testing an application for analysing the
behaviour of a person recorded by a set of sensors installed in its house. The historical log of the personâ€™s
activity is stored as tuples (start_time, end_time, activity_label), where start_timeand end_time represent the
date and time when each activity has started and ended while the activity label represents the type of activity
performed by the person: Leaving, Toileting, Showering, Sleeping, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack,
Spare_Time/TV, Grooming. The data is spread over several days.
